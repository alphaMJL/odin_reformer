“This is part of the Forms Project in The Odin Project’s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at http://www.theodinproject.com”

This project explored how forms and models interact in rails.  
The project involved writing out a new user form in pure HTML, then using form_tag, then form_with  
and having each successfully interact with the model.

Relevant code can be found in:

views/new.html.erb
controllers/users_controllers.rb

The only view is the new.html
